## Hello!

This is a small Three.js project that shows a head in front of a plane, which is turning - that somehow evolved into being my portfolio page. The entire thing, that is. Not only the head, as you may have guessed.

Obligatory Shoutout to Bruno Simon and his course on [Three.js](https://threejs-journey.com/).

## But why?

Having developed a lot with Next.js lately (which I truly enjoy) I couldn't help but notice how much I rely on frameworks, npm bundle magic and whatnot to set up a web page. Thus, as this project began as way to familiarize myself with Three.js and glsl-shaders on a deeper level, I began to realize that I wanted to keep everything else in this project as "vanilla" as can be. That ment using css without a compiler, pure typescript to handle Three.js and all the other logic, as well as setting up webpack on my own - yeah, don't ask.

## Available Commands - if you want to mess with things

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
