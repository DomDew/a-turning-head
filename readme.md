## Hello!

This is a Three.js project that shows a head on a plane, which is turning. The head, that is.

## But why?

Having developed a lot with Next.js lately (which I truly enjoy) I couldn't help but notice how much I rely on frameworks, npm bundle magic and whatnot to set up a web page. Thus, as this project began as way to familiarize myself with Three.js and glsl-shaders on a deeper level, I began to realize that I wanted to keep everything else in this project as "vanilla" as can be. That ment using css without a compiler, pure typescript to handle Three.js and all the other logic as well as setting up webpack on my own - yeah, don't ask.

## Available Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
