# Three.js Journey

## Hello!

This is a Three.js project that shows a head on a plane, which is turning. The head, that is. Sorry, but the head itself is hidden away in a gitignore since it is copyrighted. Sad days, my friend.

## Available Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
